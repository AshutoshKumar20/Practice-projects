        In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser engines and how the
        dimensions of those HTML elements are derived from CSS properties. It is a fundamental concept for the
        composition of HTML webpages.[3] The guidelines of the box model are described by web standards World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C) specifically the CSS Working Group. For much of the late-1990s and early 2000s there had been
        non-standard compliant implementations of the box model in mainstream browsers. With the advent of CSS2 in 1998,
        which introduced the box-sizing property, the problem had mostly been resolved.Before HTML 4 and CSS, very few
        HTML elements supported both border and padding, so the definition of the width and height of an element was not
        very contentious. However, it varied depending on the element. The HTML width attribute of a table defined the
        width of the table including its border.[7] On the other hand, the HTML width attribute of an image defined the
        width of the image itself (inside any border).[8] The only element to support padding in those early days was
        the table cell. Width for the cell was defined as "the suggested width for a cell content in pixels excluding
        the cell padding."[9]
